   Helpful macro to use weapons more easily in R6 siege.

    If you want to more easily control the scope with the lowest zoom, you can just press
  Caps Lock, but if you are using a scope with a high zoom, you can reduce the bounce by 
  pressing the “P” key. (This method is somewhat inconsistent, you can find the ideal setting by customizing the values in it).
